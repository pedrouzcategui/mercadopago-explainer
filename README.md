# Mercadopago-explainer
This repository doesn't pretend to be some kind of complete documentation for mercadopago SDK, is just only an explainer.

## Why this repository?

Recently, I began working with mercadopago api for a project and find it kinda useless, because some of the things are more or less explained, so actually after spending a week searching in forums and reading all of the groups on the internet finally I get how the whole machine works. I will use PHP for the setup but actually it's the same thing with all of the other languages.

This is the index, I will began updating the list during these days.

* Index
  * Setup the proyect
  * Using the SDK
  * Testing
  * Live
  * Security
  * Recommended Handlers
  * MercadoPago Objects
  
Feel free to reach me for questions.
